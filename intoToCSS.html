    Here is a long paragraph for you to play with. Go ahead and mess
    with it. All of the properties shown here are text properties. As
    a bonus, you can try using different units for the properties that
    take numerical values. There is already the demo of pixels and
    percent. Try "em", a relative unit (1em = the current font size). You can also try
    negative values (e.g. -10px). Some properties take negative values,
    and some do not.
